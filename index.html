I am currently a data engineer at <a href="https://www.admarketplace.com" target="_blank">adMarketplace</a> where I am responsible for building and maintaining media value measurement pipelines. I joined <a href="https://www.admarketplace.com" target="_blank">adMarketplace</a> from <a href="https://www.mercuryhealthcare.com" target="_blank">Mercury Healthcare</a>  (formerly Healthgrades), where I was focused on building, implementing, and debugging data pipelines for our clients. In addition, my team and I worked to automate data processing, improve pipeline functionality, and build microservices for accessibility. Prior to this role, I was the Director of Informatics at <a href="https://coverahealth.com/" target="_blank">Covera Health</a>, where I led a multidisciplinary team to improve data throughput, shaped data ingestion strategy, and managed vendor relationships.

<p>
Going further back, I worked in clinical informatics and research at <a href="https://phs.weill.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Weill Cornell Medicine</a>. I was primarily focused on investigating aspects of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=deferio" target="_blank">mental health care</a>, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31329877" target="_blank">social determinants</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30474077" target="_blank">prescription patterns</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815052" target="_blank">disgnostic tools</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31984323" target="_blank">major depressive disorder</a>.
</p>

<p>
In a past life, prior to Weill Cornell Medicine, I investigated health disparities, diagnosis patterns, and mortality in patients with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28764654" target="_blank">End-Stage Renal Disease</a> for <a href="https://research.downstate.edu/index.html" target="_blank">SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University</a>. At <a href="https://kidneyresearchcenter.mgh.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>, I made improvements to database design and workflows that resulted in increased quality control and data integrity. I also made contributions to research in the areas of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25770176" target="_blank">vitamin D supplementation</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23970130" target="_blank">protein carbamylation</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26266048" target="_blank">acute kidney injury</a>.
</p>

<p>
I studied Community Health Sciences and Biostatistics at <a title="MPH in Public Health" href="https://www.downstate.edu" target="_blank">SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University</a>. I also hold a degree in Biology from the <a title="Columbian College of Arts and Sciences" href="https://columbian.gwu.edu/" target="_blank">George Washington University</a>.
