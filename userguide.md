### <u>User Guide</u>
<br>

__My style__ 
- analytical, curious, process & detail oriented, enthusiastic builder  
<br>

__On environment values__  
- Organization and sustainability over speed and instant gratification
    - I value environments that promote organization and sustainability. Far too often, issues tend to pile up when these values are sacrificed (see: technical debt, rework, bug fixes, etc.) 
    - "Measure twice, cut once" is and old proverb that still rings true. There is a time and place for everything, but let's try to maintain a set of principles for everyday work.
- Question-asking and feedback delivery
    - Opportunities to enter into the feedback loop and asking "why?" questions allow for continuous learning and growth. It also opens up valuable opportunities for refinement, which are gained from different perspectives weighing in. Let's keep asking questions.
- Transparency and inclusiveness
    - Inclusiveness and transparency are important to keeping teams well-informed and working towards a unified goal. There are times when its better to inform smaller groups so that decisions can be made faster, but overall I believe in not keeping people in the dark for too long.

__On Communication__  

<!-- Sometimes I struggle to type up my ideas. Emails can take me a long time to write. I‚Äôd much rather talk things over the phone, quick Zoom or use Slack Videos to communicate tough concepts -->
<!-- Reserve Slack DMs for time-sensitive needs -->
- Hierarchy of communication (most‚Üí least urgent): Call‚Üí Text‚Üí Email‚ÜíSlack.
- When sending emails, clearly state expectations/questions. Open-ended communication or FYIs might not get a response. I will try to do the same with my outgoing correspondence
- Be specific about what‚Äôs needed and who is going to do it 
- Be efficient, hit the major points early
- During creative and problem-solving conversations, the following framework helps when asking questions:
    - ask the question 
    - add your hypothesis
    - propose a solution (if possible)
- Give me time to verify the issues and potential outcomes. This will allow me propose appropriate solutions 
- My communication style is typically straight and to the point. Please don‚Äôt interpret this as me being cold or careless. It helps me work efficiently and focus on what needs to get done.

__On Feedback__
- Feedback is a gift.
    - It should be welcomed, but not every bit of feedback requires action. Some feedback will be brilliant and its merits obvious, some will be hard to accept but warrants investigation, and some will not suit you.
- Upward feedback is valuable.
    - I believe that feedback should be shared upward, despite the fact that it may seem uncomfortable. Leaders should strive be open to feedback, which helps to develop a resilient, connected, and compassionate organization.
- Deliver feedback directly, and early.
    - Whether feedback is directed towards me, or from me to a member of my team, I believe in the power or direct and early communication. 
    - If we can work through it, let‚Äôs jointly come up with action steps for improvement.
    - If resolution is not possible, its best to be open and honest, and deliver feedback with kindness and grace.

__Things that I could do without__  

- Failing to follow through with communicated expectations.
- Micro-managing. Full stop.
    - Trust is an important element in any professional environment. If you feel the need to constantly check-in on your direct reports, we are probably not a good fit. 
    - As a leader, I aim to give my reports the tools for success and trust that they'll be able to deliver.
- Last minute changes to an established plan without an explanation.
<br>
<br>

__What I'm working on__  

- Responding to calendar invites. Historically I have acted under the assumption that the other party knows I'll be joining (unless I explicitly decline). I am working to be more explicit in my actions and keep my calendar invites up to date.
- I have a lot of pride in my work and maintain high expectations in all that I do. 
- Understanding that there are times when speed trumps structure and planning. I truly value a measured approach to building, however, there are sometimes circumstances in which this is not possible - and that is ok.
